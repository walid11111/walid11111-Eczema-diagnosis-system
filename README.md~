Eczema Diagnosis System: A Knowledge-Based Approach Using Streamlit
📌 Project Overview
This project is a knowledge-based system designed to help users diagnose potential eczema conditions based on their symptoms. It provides a simple and interactive interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input symptoms and receive a diagnosis.

🎯 Objective
Assist users in identifying eczema symptoms early.
Reduce misdiagnosis by using a rule-based approach.
Encourage timely medical attention to prevent complications.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python (Rule-based diagnosis system)
📌 How It Works
User Input: The user selects symptoms from a checklist.
Symptom Matching: The system categorizes symptoms into universal and type-specific eczema symptoms.
Diagnosis Logic:
If all universal symptoms are present → Eczema is confirmed
If type-specific symptoms match a category → Type of eczema is suggested
If symptoms are unclear → Suggests consulting a dermatologist
📌 Features
✅ User-Friendly UI: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
✅ Knowledge-Based Diagnosis: Uses rule-based logic to determine potential eczema types.
✅ Handles Ambiguity: Provides alternative suggestions for incomplete inputs.

📌 Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Ambiguous or incomplete input	Provides fallback recommendations for doctor consultation.
Diverse eczema types	Predefined clear rule sets for each type.
🚀 Future Enhancements
Expand to diagnose other skin conditions
Improve accuracy with AI-based models
Integrate with medical resources for treatment suggestions
